# What is Machine Learning ?

- Machine Learning : "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959)
 
 # Machine Learning algorithms

 - Supervised learning : Algorithm that learns from being given "right answers" (label `Y` from a given input `X`). It maps input `X` to output `Y`. 
    - Regression : Predicting house price
    - Classification : Predict a category. 




 - Unsupervised learning : Find patterns in data without any labelling.  
 - Reinforcement learning
