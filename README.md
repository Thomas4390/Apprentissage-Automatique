# What is Machine Learning ?

- Machine Learning : "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed" - Arthur Samuel (1959)
 
 # Machine Learning algorithms

 - Supervised learning : Algorithm that learns from being given "right answers" (label `Y` from a given input `X`). 
    - Regression
    - Classification
